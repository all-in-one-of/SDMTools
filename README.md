# SDMTools
This tool set is meant to facilitate certain workflows of Visual Effects students. A lot of the tools I create for this toolset are part of personal explorations and projects, as well as feature/tool requests from peers.

Currently, this is a small repository of Houdini shelf tools but I anticipate to broaden this to a full package that spans other packages.
