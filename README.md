# SDMTools
This toolset is meant to facilitate certain workflows of not only my Visual Effects peers at SCAD, but other artists as well. A lot of the tools I create for this toolset are part of personal explorations and projects, as well as feature/tool requests from peers.

Currently, this is a small repository of Houdini shelf tools, HDAs, and menu scripts but I anticipate to broaden this to other packages.

The toolset is very self-contained once you install it (and it even installs itself!). Any updates I release to GitHub you can automatically download and install from within Houdini. In the future, I will bolster the installation script so that you can cherry pick what tools/features you want installed.
