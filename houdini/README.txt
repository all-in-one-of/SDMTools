The intention of this toolset is to provide sought after functionality for Houdini users of SDM. Github link coming soon. Feature requests are encouraged, please contact me.

=== INSTALLATION ===

- For at home usage, you can place the SDMTools directory anywhere. For users working on multiple computers, I recommend saving this on a network drive, so that it can follow you around computer to computer. Do not re-arrange any of the contents.

- Execute the 'install.py' python script from a shell, i.e.:

cd path/to/SDMToolsDirectory/houdini
python install.py path/to/your/houdini.env

- If you are unsure on the path of the houdini.env file, you can run 'python install.py -h' for some tips.

- This will properly update the given houdini.env with the correct environment variables to receive all configurations, shelves, HDAs, etc.

- Restart Houdini
