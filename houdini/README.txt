This library is written and maintained by Sasha Ouellet (www.sashaouellet.com)

The intention of this toolset is to provide sought after functionality for Houdini users of SDM. Github link coming soon. Feature requests are encouraged, please contact me.

=== INSTALLATION ===

- Please place this entire SDM_Tools subdirectory in a location on a network drive, so that it can follow you around computer to computer. Do not extract any of the contents.

- Execute the 'install.py' python script from a shell, i.e.:

cd path/to/this/directory
python install.py

- This will properly update your houdini.env with the correct environment variables to receive all configurations, shelves, HDAs, etc.

- Restart Houdini
